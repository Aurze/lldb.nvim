INTRODUCTION                                            *lldb-intro*

The plugin provides an interface to the lldb debugger allowing for
convenient debugging sessions inside your favorite editor including
features such as breakpoints, stepping, watchpoints etc.

The original plugin can be found here:

http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk/utils/vim-lldb/

Credit for pretty much all current functionality goes to the original
authors. Currently, work has been done to migrate the existing features
to use Neovim's new API so that the user interface is much more responsive.
Also, the focus has been to simplify the code wherever possible, so that
it will be easier to debug and extend.

FEATURES                                                *lldb-features*

* Buffers showing backtrace, breakpoints, threads, locals, registers and
  disassembly.
* Tab-completion for LLDB commands
* Event-based UI updates
* Non-blocking UI
  Exception: May block while fetching the tab-completion list.
* Customizable Layout
  See |lldb-customizing|.

GETTING STARTED                                         *lldb-start*

To quickly get started compile (with debugging symbols) the source and
open a source file belonging to the program in Neovim, and execute
>
    :LLtarget create /path/to/executable
<
Notice that all built-in commands have tab-completion enabled.
With cursor on some line in the source file, press <M-b> to set a breakpoint
at that line. Alternatively, you can execute:
>
    :LLbreakpoint set --name function_name
<
Now, execute |:LLredraw|, and execute one of
>
    :LLprocess launch
    :LLprocess launch -- args
    :LLprocess launch -i infile -o outfile -- args
<
Once the program reaches the specified breakpoint you will be able to
inspect state and step through the program using the commands described below.

Don't forget that, since the debugger is asynchronous, you can interrupt an
unresponsive process using:
>
    :LLprocess interrupt
<
Once it's interrupted, you can select your frame of interest using one of
>
    :LLup [num]
    :LLdown [num]
    :LLframe select <frame-index>
<
Alternatively, you can kill it using:
>
    :LLprocess kill
<

COMMANDS                                                *lldb-commands*

The LLDB command interpreter is exposed to Vim's command mode using the
':LL' prefix. Tab-completion is available and will cycle through commands.
Some commands have modified behaviour.

                        Insert breakpoint at cursor location.

I recommend setting the following maps:

ISSUES AND BUGS                                         *lldb-bugs*

When in doubt, please feel free to discuss at Gitter:
https://gitter.im/critiqjo/lldb.nvim

If you run into a bug, use the Github issue tracker to report it:
https://github.com/critiqjo/lldb.nvim/issues

It would be nice if you could set the following environment variable:
>
    export NVIM_PYTHON_LOG_FILE=/tmp/nvlog
<
and post the log along with the bug report.

CONTRIBUTING                                            *lldb-contributing*

That'd would be great! But until version 0.9 is released, I'll be making many
breaking changes to the plugin. You can monitor the progress in dev-branches.
For instance, I've planned taking out most of the LL- commands and replacing
it with a prompt, enabling execution of literally any commands, and definition
of aliases. Therefore please wait until the plugin workflow is stabilized.
